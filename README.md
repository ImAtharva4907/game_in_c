# Number guessing game in C language

This C program is a simple number guessing game. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the rand() function from the <stdlib.h> library and the time() function from the <time.h> library. It then asks the user to guess the number by repeatedly taking input from the user in a do-while loop until the correct number is guessed.
